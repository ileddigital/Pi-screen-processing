SO I think a good placew to start will be to play around with processing and telegram. 
If we do that, we can get a basic 'phone' or telegram-phone up and running... ok, we'll need to tether from our own phones
or get a MiFi, but it will be a start.

Will start playing with processing and this... 

Quite like the idea of making our own physical versions of a telegram phone with different ways of 'ringing'. maybe it taps you 
on the shoulder to say a call is coming.... maybe a marble rolls to your desk (thinking Durrell Bishop here)... not sure. Just thoughts
and need to spend some time on it in coming weeks.
