Step 1 - unbox and set up.
We're setting up a PI 3 with a TFT resistive touch screen. 
More open notes than specific tutorial

 

Timing - 30 minutes + 1 hour download  + 15 minutes flash (devices will vary) 

// Ingredients.

A Pi 3
Micro SD card 8GB
SD card apapter - i'm lucky enough to have a mac with and SD card slot... 
Power source - micro USB B 
An Ada Fruit  PiTfT Plus 320x240 2.8" Resistive touch scren 
http://adafru.it/2298

We'll come back to Resistive Vs Capacative...

I'm working on a MAC BOOK pro and have Processing 3 installed. 

OK. That's it... 


// Method

Put SD card (using adapter) into the SD slot on your computer
Download operating system Raspbian OS (ROS) with drivers for the TFT on it. 
https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pitft-28-inch-resistive-touchscreen-display-raspberry-pi/easy-install

This is Raspbian + drivers. If you just want Raspbian - go here. 
from https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/ 

Once you've got this. 
Expand ROS zip file it'll be a file in your downloads
Burn the ROS onto the SD card - download Etcher from here https://etcher.io/ - and follow your normal setup process

In Etcher
Select image - it will be where your up-zipper placed it (probably same drive as the downloads) - file ends in .img
Select drive - your SD slot on your computer
Flash - this will take around 15 minutes 

// Otis says don't forget to format the SD card before (and erase all the data) 

While Etcher is flashing...
 - build the hardware. 
 - put the TFT screen into the PI GPIO pins. Simples... 
 
WHEN it's done
 - eject disk (you might not see it in finder so use disk utility)
 
 Now we're ready to go. 
 
 Put SD into the Pi. 
 Power her up. 
 
 You'll see LEDS flashing on the PI side and stuff on the screen - lots of text... then it'll open a minute or two later. 
 
 // Otis is struggling with the screen size... ha - and he's got young eyes... 
 
 Click on the PI logo on top left to open menu
  -> accessories->terminal
 
 // Otis-note - if you've a keyboard with a windows button you can use that to open the home menu
 
 That's it we're ready to go! 
 
 // except that the screen resolution is too small - so we can't actually get to changing it through Raspbian windows... 
 so we need to go into a terminal window
 
 we looked here... 
 
 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22891235/how-to-change-screen-resolution-of-raspberry-pi
 
 TIP - there's a problem in that the driver thinks the screen is bigger than it is. We're working on finding out how to correct this
 (lots of things don't work)... BUT if you hold down ALT on your keyboard (CMD on mac) and left-click you can drag the screen 
 around with the trackpad/mouse.

 screen no.2 - the pimoroni hyperpixel multiple touch (capacitive) 800x480
 
 the setup guide for this screen is here - https://github.com/pimoroni/hyperpixel
 
 first of all start with the vanilla Raspbian OS found here - https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
 
 then burn/flash Raspbian to your sd card using etcher
 // remember to format the sd card first
 
 boot it up using a seperate hdmi monitor
 
 open terminal and execute the following command
   
       curl https://get.pimoroni.com/hyperpixel | bash
 
 after this reboot using
 
       sudo reboot
       
and it should work with the hyperpixel screen
