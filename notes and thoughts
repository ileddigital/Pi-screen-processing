Using this space to throw thoughts in...

What about facial recognition?
Us it to locate people in a room - and then set up calls using telegram. 
Or for a central server to deliver a marble to someone's desk (thinking Uniform's Sweet Tweets) based on who the message
is for and where they are in the room... 

What kind of physical ways can we 'ring' a phone...
