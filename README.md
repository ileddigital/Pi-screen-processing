# Pi-screen-processing
Intro to setting up touch screen[s] on PI 3 and then running processing apps.
Feb 2018

Me and Otis are working on our dream of making our own programmable open source phone platform. 

This is where we'll (try) to put evertything we do.... 

.. don't expect an Ah Ha moment... we most likely will never get there. I'm not exactly a middle aged Steve Jobs and he's not a young Ellon Musk... (well not yet). it's just a dad and a kid being geeks on a sunday...

It's going to be more like the film Be Kind Rewind - where the owners of a video rental shop decide to re-make versions of classic films....  

So if we make a 'phone' - it will be our version of one. 
If we make a bike satnav - it will be our version...

Don't expect greatness! 

What we have got so far
Day 1: Sunday 25th Feb
    PI 3 with two touch screens - running
    Processing 3 running
    VNC (so you can use macbook pro  or other laptop) to be the screen/keyboard.
    Notes - but not much more - on Telegram
