You have to be able to make a great cheese toasty. 

Here's how we like them

You'll need a cast iron skillet. If you've not got one, go and get one now.

// Ingredients
Bread - your choice - today's was KrostenBrot (german brown bread with a krust)
Goats cheese
Kate's Fig Chutney
Olive Oil (butter also ok) 

//Method
Heat skillet on medium heat. Get it fully warmed up.

While it's heating make two cheese and chutney sandwhiches. 

Add olive oil to the skillet - about two table spoons
Put sandwhiches in the pan
Cook on either side until almost burnt! It's essential to press down on them when they've cooking
Done.
